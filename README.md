Code written in support of testing various bounds in [More Tales of Hoffman: bounds for the vector chromatic number of a graph](https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.02613)

## run instructions
`python conj.py test --help`

## caveats
Running this code with the intention of using `named` graphs requires a directory of the name `GraphData`, with DOT files of graphs contained within. More about DOT files can be found [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DOT_%28graph_description_language%29).
